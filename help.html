					<p>There are many ways we can help our planet stray from suffering an accelerated death by making a few lifestyle alterations.</p>

						<p>Many Americans often don't realize how severe the damage can be from gas powered vehicles. Instead of driving a personal gas-powered car, try taking public transportation. When it is possible, try walking or biking to your destination. You'll be killing two birds with one stone by exercising and helping the planet simultaneously!</p>

						<h1>Power</h1>
						<img src="images/ecopower.jpg" alt="Eco-friendly Transportation" class="round">
						<p>It's no secret that our homes are filled with electronics, most of which are being powered by electricity, which results in a large amount of gas emissions. Make sure to unplug your appliances when they're not in use, and that you're using the least amount of electricity that you can. Even something as small as turning the lights off throughout the day can make a difference. If possible, start investing in renewable energy sources such as solar energy.</p>

						<h1>Nutrition</h1>
						<img src="images/econutrition.png" alt="Eco-friendly Transportation" class="round">
						<p>Believe it or not, you are making a difference by changing your dietary habits. A good chunk of energy used by the US is devoted towards processing and preparing food. Most of this processed food ends up polluting our landfills due to being tossed aside. If we can all reduce our intake of meat and stop wasting food, we can all help the planet.</p>
