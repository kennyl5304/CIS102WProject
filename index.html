					<h1>Welcome to EarthShield</h1>
					<p>We are a nonprofit website dedicated to spreading awareness about climate change, an issue that's currently plaguing our beloved Earth.</p>
					<p>Here, you will find some tips on how to live a better, eco-friendly lifestyle, links to official resources, as well as ways you can help stall this ongoing process.</p>
					<p>Climate change is a real problem which can be scientifically proven. Our planet is heating up at an unnatural pace, and if we continue to stay ignorant about this issue, there may no longer be an Earth for us to inhabit in the near future.</p>
					<h3>Let us all come together to be the shield that helps our Earth see a brighter future!</h3>

							<p>Hey, I'm Kenny. I'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science. I've been delving in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for 3 years now, and I believe it's now time to use those skills to push forward a cause I believe in. In my free time, I play video games and practice playing music. For more information, feel free to check out my <a href="https://kennyluongest.blogspot.com/">blog!</a></p>
